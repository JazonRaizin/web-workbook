  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <article>
    I am from Corpus Christi TX and moved to Houston TX when i was 8 years old.
    <br> I then later moved to Austin TX when i was 13 years old and attended Eastside memorial Highschool for my freshman year and then finished at McCallum Highschool.
    <br> While at McCallum Highschool I performed Volunteer work for a consession company called 1883 Provision Co. Austin TX<br> to help raise funds fot the Baile Folklorico program at McCallum ran by one of the Spanish teachers Juana Gun.
    <br> Torwards the last two months of my senior year at McCallum Highschool i started working as a Video Game Tester and Design intern for Gaming Corps Austin
    <br> I am now taking classes at Austin Coding Academy to help learn how to be more useful at my current job and also to maybe find an even better position and or job with new skills.
